# TensorFlow Pokemon Course

The dataset we'll be using is the compilation of stats and traits for the Pokémon video games. Pokémon is a popular game for generations of Nintendo handheld video game 
consoles where players collect and train animal-like creatures called Pokémon. We'll be creating a model to try to predict whether a Pokémon is a legendary Pokémon, a rare
type of Pokémon who's the only one of its species.

There are a lot of existing compilations of Pokémon stats, but we'll be using a .CSV version [found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alopez247/pokemon).
